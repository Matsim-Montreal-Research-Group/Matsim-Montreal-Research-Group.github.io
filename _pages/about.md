Suppervised by professor Francesco Ciari, MATSim Montreal Research Group is an academic research group based in Polytechnique University (Montreal, Canada) dedicated to the development and the application of MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation), a widely used open-source framework for simulating and analyzing transportation systems.

The MATSim Montreal Research Group consists of a team of researchers, master and PhD students who collaborate on advancing the capabilities of MATSim framework and exploring its applications in different domains and contexts. They conduct research projects, develop new features and algorithms with the objective of contributing to the ongoing improvement of MATSim.

The group's research often focuses on areas such as transportation infrastructure planning, public transportation analysis, transportation mode optimization and mobility behavior modeling. They aim to address real-world transportation challenges and provide insights. These insights inform policy decisions and improve the efficiency of transportation systems.

The MATSim Montreal Research Group plays an important role in advancing the field of transportation research by developing and applying innovative simulation tools, algorithms and methodologies that lead to a better understanding and improvement of transportation systems.
