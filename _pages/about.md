Led by the professor Francesco Ciari, the MATSim research group is an academic research group dedicated to the development and application of MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation), a widely used open-source framework for simulating and analyzing transportation systems. MATSim is designed to model the behavior of individual travelers and their interactions with the transportation network, allowing researchers to study various aspects of transportation planning and policy.

The MATSim research group consists of a team of researchers and developers who collaborate on advancing the capabilities of the MATSim framework and exploring its applications in different domains. They conduct research projects, develop new features and algorithms, and contribute to the ongoing improvement and maintenance of MATSim.

The group's research often focuses on areas such as traffic congestion management, transportation infrastructure planning, public transportation analysis, and mobility behavior modeling. They aim to address real-world transportation challenges and provide insights that can inform policy decisions and improve the efficiency and sustainability of transportation systems.

The MATSim research group actively engages with the academic community and collaborates with researchers from universities, research institutions, and industry partners worldwide. They publish their findings in academic journals and conference proceedings, and they also organize workshops and conferences to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration within the transportation research community.

Overall, the MATSim research group plays a vital role in advancing the field of transportation research by developing and applying innovative simulation tools and methodologies that contribute to the understanding and improvement of transportation systems.
